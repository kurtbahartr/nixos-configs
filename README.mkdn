# NixOS Configs

Configuration files for NixOS. This isn't a part of [linux-configs](https://github.com/kurtbahartr/linux-configs) family because it's configured the Nix way.

# Target workflow

- Sane internet browsing
- Gap-bridged Office experience (to make it easier to migrate from Microsoft 365 suite)
- Python programming with Qt
- Revamped terminal shell (feat. [LunarShell](https://lunarshell.dev)+zsh)

> Review the configuration files to see which packages are installed and configured.

# Technologies involved
- Nix
- Nix Flakes
- Nix Home Manager

# Pre-install steps

- Modify the configs to reflect your hostname in the base install's `configuration.nix`, rebuild and reboot once.
- Modify `lib/nvidia.nix` to reflect your PC's PCI Bus addresses.
  - This can be acquired via `lshw` like so: `sudo nix run 'nixpkgs#lshw' -- -c display`
- Review the packages and configs. Not everyone is content with my preferences.
- Place Cider flatpak bundle (`cider-linux-x64.flatpak`) into the `cider/` directory if you're going to install it. Otherwise, comment out the relevant `flatpak install` section in `lib/flatpak.nix`.

# Installation

- Copy the files to `/etc/nixos`.
- `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
- Reboot.

# Post-install steps

- Set up distrobox with an Ubuntu container and install Bifrost (search for SamloaderKotlin) into it if you're willing to work with Samsung firmwares.
  - This will be automated when `home-manager` pushes `programs.distrobox` configuration into stable.
- Set up Zen Browser and install the following extensions for a saner and cleaner Internet experience:
  - Bring Twitter Back: To revert "X" branding, iconography and terminology back to "Twitter" as we're all used to. (The URL is still "x.com", that cannot be tampered with as long as `twitter.com` is valid and redirects to `x.com`.)
  - Proton Pass (also sign into it): To have a privacy conscious password and passkey manager/provider. It's free to use and there's no limit to how many passwords and passkeys you can store whatsoever.
  - uBlock Origin: To get rid of ads, common cookie banners and newsletter pop-ups all across the internet, including on YouTube and Medium.
- Also import the Zen Mods in `extra/` directory. View its contents to know what will be installed. It's in JSON format, so removing entries to omit specific Mods is also possible.
- Once done, toggle the following settings in Zen Settings:
  - General
    - Tabs
      - [x] Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order
  - Look and Feel
    - Vertical Tabs
      - [x] Show New Tab Button on Tab List
        - [x] Show separation border for when the new tab button is at the bottom
        - [ ] Move the new tab button to the top
- `gh auth login` if you use GitHub.
- Pair your Android device through wireless debugging using `adb pair` if you're willing to use USB/wireless debugging.
- Set up WayDroid and install Inat BOX into it if you're willing to do so. Search for the APK yourself.
- Visit https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines/new-linux and generate an install script. Then copy the `sudo tailscale up --auth-key=<key>` part and paste it into your terminal.
- If your Tailnet has subnet servers, do the following command and restart Tailscale:
  - `sudo tailscale set --accept-routes`
- If you want to use an exit node available on your Tailnet, do the following command and restart Tailscale:
  - `sudo tailscale set --exit-node=<machine-name>`

# Bugs

- Connecting to external display disconnects the built-in display on modern Nvidia laptops. The solution is logging out and logging back in while the display is connected.
